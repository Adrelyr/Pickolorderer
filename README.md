A Very unefficient C# color averager and sorter

Got bored in an afternoon, wanted to order some of my drawings by hue, so I made this.\
Its slow, and probably coded like shit but it works. Averaging colors? My man I take all pixels at once and average that at the end lol\

Do what you wish with this lol
